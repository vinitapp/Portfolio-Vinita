                    </br>
                    <p>I'm an Australian based UX/UI Designer and Front-End Developer.
                        I'm passionate about my work and looking forward to work in the fast paced digital user
                        experience
                        designing.
                        Having a background in designing I understand the principles of usability, functionality and
                        sense
                        of duty.
                    </p>

                    <p>I also hold a diploma in Interior Designing. Previously, I have worked as an Interior
                        Designer
                        and
                        Kitchen Design Specialist at IKEA. My experience in these roles have sharpened my skills in
                        designing, working in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment, interacting with people,
                        helping
                        and
                        understanding their needs and finding efficient solutions to problems.</p>

                        <h3 style="color:#F2CF59;">UX/UI Design?</h3>

                        <p>I love finding opportunities for a good user experience. Working in customer oriented
                            industry has helped me to understand people's behaviour, needs, gives me an opportunity
                            to
                            directly interact with the people to solve their space problems by giving suggestions
                            and
                            digitally designing. </p>
                        <p style="color: #F2CF59;font-weight: 600;font-size: 28px; text-align: center;">"Designing
                            is
                            not just to showcase your creativity but also to
                            implement the design in the real world."</p>
                        <p>There is no limitations learning new things, designing was always a part of me so I chose
                            to
                            pursue this new path into UX/UI Designing. I realized that I strongly follow the five
                            step
                            problem solving process in my current position by conducting user research and
                            interacting
                            with the people to acheive their goals by solving their concerns, providing them with
                            efficient solutions, iterating design, digital sketches by using softwares and
                            delivering
                            the final product.</p>
