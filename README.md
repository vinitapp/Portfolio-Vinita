                    <p>I'm an Australian based UX/UI Designer and Front-End Developer.
                        I'm passionate about my work and looking forward to work in the fast paced digital user
                        experience
                        designing.
                        Having a background in designing I understand the principles of usability, functionality and
                        sense
                        of duty.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also hold a diploma in Interior Designing. Previously, I have worked as an Interior
                        Designer
                        and
                        Kitchen Design Specialist at IKEA. My experience in these roles have sharpened my skills in
                        designing, working in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment, interacting with people,
                        helping
                        and
                        understanding their needs and finding efficient solutions to problems.</p>
